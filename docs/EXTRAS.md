# Optional: Demo Video & Presentation

> Supporting materials for ShipOrSkip. For technical evaluation, judges should refer to the [code](../src/), [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md), and [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) first.

## Demo Video

- **Demo walkthrough:** _Link pending (Day 5)_
- **Duration:** ~2 minutes
- **Content:** Full user flow — landing → validate idea → explore projects → project detail → onchain verification

## AI Development Process

ShipOrSkip was built with significant AI assistance across the entire development lifecycle. The full process is documented in [AI_BUILD_LOG.md](AI_BUILD_LOG.md).

### What AI Built

| Phase | AI-Assisted Output |
|-------|-------------------|
| Planning | Project plan (1816 lines), brand strategy, frontend architecture (1184 lines) |
| Design | Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing, effects) |
| Backend | Data pipeline scripts, API routes, scoring engine |
| Frontend | All UI components, layouts, forms, loading states |
| Smart Contract | Solidity contract boilerplate |
| Docs | README, PROJECT.md, TECHNICAL.md |

### Methodology

```
Per Component:
  1. Human decides WHAT to build (scope, priority)
  2. AI generates the implementation (code, copy, configs)
  3. Human reviews + tests (quality gate)
  4. AI iterates if needed (fix/improve)
  5. Human commits + pushes (git log)

Human decisions: Scope, priorities, cut decisions, acceptance testing, architecture sign-off.
AI execution: Code generation, pipeline scripts, component implementation, documentation.
```
